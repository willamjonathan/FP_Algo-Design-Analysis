<b><h1>Algorithm and Design Analysis:</h1></b>
<h3><b>Dear reader,</h3>
<br>
<t>This github repository contains the files that is used to create our Final Project for Algorithm and Design Analysis Final Project.<br><br>
The team members: <br><br>
1.William Jonathan Mulyadi // 2502045683<br>

1. ADA-FP-PYGAME<br>
2. Report<br><br>
3. bogo-7strings.py<br>

The ADA-FP-PYGAME file: contains the code of our program.<br>
The Report: contains the report which include the problem statement, flow, manuals, etc. <br>
The bogo-7strings.py file: contains simple implementation of the bogo sorting algorithm with 7 strings array (to test the run time and memory taken of bogo sorting algorithm with small array).<br>

<br>
<h1> MANUALS: </h1> <br>
To run the program please download all the files in the folder ADA-FP-PYGAME.<br> Then run the file <b>runpage.py</b>.<br>Do not forget to install the pygame first, and to make sure the calculation of the time and memory accurate, please close all of the running files in your computer before exeecuting the program!<br>
